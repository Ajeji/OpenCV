Animal Detection Model Repository Documentation
Overview
Welcome to the Animal Detection Model repository! This repository contains code and resources for developing and deploying an animal
detection model using deep learning.

Introduction
The primary goal of this project is to develop an accurate and robust animal detection model that can identify various animals within images.
The model will be based on deep learning and transfer learning techniques, leveraging pre-trained neural network architectures.

Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine using: git clone https://github.com/your-username/animal-detection-model.git

Model Architecture
The core of the animal detection model utilizes a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) as a backbone. 
The final layers of the network are customized to perform object detection and classification.

Dataset
The animal detection model has been trained on a diverse dataset containing images of various animals. 
The dataset is organized into classes, each representing a different animal category.
